## 🛠️ Usage Guide

### 🔴 Prerequisites: <br>
**Python3 and wget must be installed on your<br>
system before performing the following steps.**<br><br>
First of all clone the repository and change the directory<br>
to the cloned repo. Provide proper execution permissions.<br>
Finally run the Tsunami.sh file in your Linux Terminal.<br>

```
apt install python3 curl git -y
git clone https://github.com/utsanjan/Tsunami-Bomber
cd Tsunami-Bomber
chmod +x Tsunami.sh
./Tsunami.sh
```
Next the script will ask you to enter the Victim's Phone No.<br>
and the number of SMS you want to send respectively.
<br>For Example:<br>

```
./Tsunami.sh
Enter the Victim's Phone No.: +91 "ENTER_10_DIGIT_NUMBER_HERE"
Now enter the SMS count: "ENTER_THE_NUMBER_OF_SMS_TO_SEND"
```

Yeah, it does show Syntax Error but that doesn't actually matter.<br>
Everytime it shows the error it sends a SMS Bombing request.

and even the android version of this which depends<br>
mostly on his APIs. Thanks a lot MrSp4rX for the APIs.** <br>
